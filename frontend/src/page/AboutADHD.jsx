                  How do we <strong>fully understand</strong> Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that
                  possibly affects millions of children and adults around the world? It is important to know
                  that ADHD is not something that just affects children but it's a lifelong condition. So what is
                  ADHD? What can we positively contribute to raise further awareness and prevent
                  misconceptions from spreading? These are the common questions when it comes to
                  <strong> ADHD awareness</strong>. üß†

                  <strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</strong> is a neurodivergent condition that can

                  Kids with ADHD may exhibit the same symptoms, but it can also be more challenging
                  for them to focus and control their emotions. Considering how young they are, children
